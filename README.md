iCommunity Reporter:
====================

“iCommunity Reporter” is a Web Based Software System to help the Ugandan community and NTV viewers at large, 
to solve the problem of lack of community involvement in news contribution, 
this is important because, there is very little involvement by the local community, 
towards news contribution in Uganda; we will achieve this by implementing a secure, 
multi-platform open web based system that can be used on Mobile, Tablet and PC, 
which will enable users submit news stories safe and securely


The main challenge we are trying to solve with our system is that, 
there is very little involvement by the community towards news contribution.
Most users are submitting news through social networks like Facebook and Twitter, 
others are using Phone and SMS, while others go directly to the NTV news room to deliver news stories.

Our solution will work by collecting news stories sent to NTV by the viewers, people within the community, 
people in the diaspora, and any other NTV viewers.

It will work because it is an open Web based system, easily accessible through or almost any internet enabled device.
It will eliminate the need to post news stories on social media that are aimed at NTV, as views will directly post their 
news worthy stories, to the NTV News room.

It will be used by NTV viewers, members of the community, and members in the diaspora.
They will use the solution to directly post news worthy stories that they would like to bring to NTV’s attention, 
or share with NTV News room.

The solution will also be used, by the NTV journalists in the field to submit their News stories/reports, 
directly to the news room, eliminating the need to submit their stories through a third party cloud website.
